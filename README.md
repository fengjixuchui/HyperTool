Develop based on [HyperPlatForm](https://github.com/tandasat/HyperPlatform) and Only x64.

**This project can be used as a system analysis tool, vulnerability mining tool, etc., and has good stability and scalability. You can perform secondary development at will, and support operating systems above Windows 10**





**TODO:**

- [ ] The VmInitialization function will cause the virtual machine operating system to hang.

  After the hang virtual machine is suspended, vmss2core will also crash when parsing the snapshot memory.

  So hard to find bug.
